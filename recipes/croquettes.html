    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add potatoes to a large pot of salted boiled water; cook until tender, around 15 minutes.  Drain and pour potatoes 
            into a large bowl.  Stir in butter and mash.
        </li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Stir in onions and cook
            until soft.  Stir in beef and soy sauce.  Cook, stirring continously, until beef is browned and all liquid
            is evaporated.  Combine beef and onions with potatoes, and stir well.
        </li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 cup oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat</li>
        <li>Shape potato and beef mixture into 10 similarly sized balls, then flatten into
            patties.  Dredge patties in flour, then dip in egg, and coat with panko bread crumbs.
